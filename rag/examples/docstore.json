I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\r\n\r\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\r\n\r\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\r\n\r\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 1997, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52679997-69e8-4004-a8ca-a183e481fb00": {"__data__": {"id_": "52679997-69e8-4004-a8ca-a183e481fb00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "F:\\AiData\\paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75393, "creation_date": "2024-08-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b95ccce5-091c-478e-86ca-6ebabddfcde1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "F:\\AiData\\paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75393, "creation_date": "2024-08-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-26"}, "hash": "063233989714fba060f8fdcffbfcc3f4cf6264f58ba2524a0e76347d6a31bb98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7499b7a-879b-45ee-bcdc-6ebc0f9ee157", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "F:\\AiData\\paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75393, "creation_date": "2024-08-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-26"}, "hash": "60f46150cac3b28811afa338bba0db997a554b2a306e77f19bee3c6708e58887", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b3d43ff-e2d4-4881-9c3c-e58b223667f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "524d2af3471559767173be38bbd1888a8bceb485f95beaf87248cd412d83f541", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I was puzzled by the 1401.

Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping.

I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\r\n\r\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book.

It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths.

All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\r\n\r\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.

The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\r\n\r\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program.

The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\r\n\r\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things.

Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.\r\n\r\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\r\n\r\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.

[3]\r\n\r\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.

For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it!

[7]\r\n\r\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist \u2014 in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\r\n\r\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\r\n\r\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber.

Now you could just update the software right on the server.\r\n\r\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.\r\n\r\nAt this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes.

It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.

If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.\r\n\r\nAlas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months.

It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.\r\n\r\nI got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else.

I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\r\n\r\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.\r\n\r\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls).

If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then.

The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\r\n\r\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it.

So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\r\n\r\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\r\n\r\nOne of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup.

The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination.

We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\r\n\r\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\r\n\r\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke.

Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\r\n\r\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\r\n\r\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\r\n\r\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months.

Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\r\n\r\nMcCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\r\n\r\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.

I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there.

I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.

Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\r\n\r\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\r\n\r\nHere's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change.

Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\r\n\r\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 73078, "end_char_idx": 75365, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23e5ca4b-76d4-4bb1-b79e-c220a558c784": {"__data__": {"id_": "23e5ca4b-76d4-4bb1-b79e-c220a558c784", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "F:\\AGI\\data\\llama2.pdf", "file_name": "llama2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 283352, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-12", "total_pages": 5, "source": "1"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37e597ef-fcf4-4684-9a8a-bc3c7b065994", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "F:\\AGI\\data\\llama2.pdf", "file_name": "llama2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 283352, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-12", "total_pages": 5, "source": "1"}, "hash": "5c0ee8c5667551397851ff078f1cf982e5486867afcdb02d779195bc8f0641c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d968a63a-f848-476c-8612-004879fee50a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3489de34bf87018109bcdc828d1d6173595961e5b9591e07ef1781179fcd4e04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\nHugo Touvron\u2217\nLouis Martin\u2020\nKevin Stone\u2020\nPeter Albert Amjad Almahairi Yasmine Babaei Nikolay Bashlykov Soumya Batra\nPrajjwal Bhargava Shruti Bhosale Dan Bikel Lukas Blecher Cristian Canton Ferrer Moya Chen\nGuillem Cucurull David Esiobu Jude Fernandes Jeremy Fu Wenyin Fu Brian Fuller\nCynthia Gao Vedanuj Goswami Naman Goyal Anthony Hartshorn Saghar Hosseini Rui Hou\nHakan Inan Marcin Kardas Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa Isabel Kloumann Artem Korenev\nPunit Singh Koura Marie-Anne Lachaux Thibaut Lavril Jenya Lee Diana Liskovich\nYinghai Lu Yuning Mao Xavier Martinet Todor Mihaylov Pushkar Mishra\nIgor Molybog Yixin Nie Andrew Poulton Jeremy Reizenstein Rashi Rungta Kalyan Saladi\nAlan Schelten Ruan Silva Eric Michael Smith Ranjan Subramanian Xiaoqing Ellen Tan Binh Tang\nRoss Taylor Adina Williams Jian Xiang Kuan Puxin Xu Zheng Yan Iliyan Zarov Yuchen Zhang\nAngela Fan Melanie Kambadur Sharan Narang Aurelien Rodriguez Robert Stojnic\nSergey Edunov\nThomas Scialom\u2217\nGenAI, Meta\nAbstract\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and \ufb01ne-tuned\nlarge language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.\nOur \ufb01ne-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.

Following this, we create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat through the application\nof supervised \ufb01ne-tuning. Subsequently, the model is iteratively re\ufb01ned using Reinforcement Learning\nwith Human Feedback (RLHF) methodologies, speci\ufb01cally through rejection sampling and Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO). Throughout the RLHF stage, the accumulation of iterative reward modeling data in\nparallel with model enhancements is crucial to ensure the reward models remain within distribution.\n2\nPretraining\nTo create the new family of Llama 2 models, we began with the pretraining approach described in Touvron et al.\n(2023), using an optimized auto-regressive transformer, but made several changes to improve performance.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we performed more robust data cleaning, updated our data mixes, trained on 40% more total\ntokens, doubled the context length, and used grouped-query attention (GQA) to improve inference scalability\nfor our larger models.

We use a cosine learning rate schedule, with warmup of 2000 steps, and decay\n\ufb01nal learning rate down to 10% of the peak learning rate. We use a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping\nof 1.0.
